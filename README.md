# degree-and-master
#In this repository I have added all the works of interest done during my Physics degree and master's degree in Advanced Physics.

#There are works on different topics, I hope some of them can be of interest to you :).

#In the research folder you can find the most interesting ones, which are my bachelor's degree project, master's degree project, stay in Rome and the research carried out with a grant I was awarded.

#In the Degree and Master folders you will find different works, where ‘gx’ refers to ‘degree’ and ‘x’ to the course in which I did the corresponding internship, and ‘m1’ to the works done during my master.

#If you have any questions, you can send me an email to afloto@alumni.uv.es, f92fltoa@correo.ugr.es
